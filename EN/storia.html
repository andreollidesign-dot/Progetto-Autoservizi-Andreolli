        <p>Autoservizi Andreolli was founded in 1981 by Silvano Andreolli, a determined man and travel enthusiast. With simplicity and dedication, he created a service that soon became essential to the local community. His goal was clear: to take people wherever they needed to go, ensuring safety, serenity and respect for each individual.</p>

        <p>Over the years, his commitment inspired three of his children – Franco, Paolo and Luca – who decided to carry on the journey started by their father. They worked side by side for over forty years, strengthening the company’s reputation for reliability and constant presence throughout the region.</p>
        <p>A story made of travelled roads, sudden snowfalls, school routes, group trips and thousands of people accompanied safely.</p>

        <p>Today, the company is led by Paolo Andreolli, who after decades behind the wheel is gradually passing the baton to his daughter Gaia, who grew up in this environment and has always played an active role in the family business.</p>
        <p>A photograph taken over twenty years ago shows them “at work”: Paolo in the driver’s seat and little Gaia on his lap. A simple image that tells the natural origin of this journey.</p>
